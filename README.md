# AccountStore

AccountStore - Password Manager is the ad-free password manager designed for your daily use.

* You only need to remember one master password, and the rest is handled by the app!

When it comes to security, AccountStore - Password Manager is the solution because it stores your passwords locally without using the internet.
Your data is encrypted using AES 256 encryption method, so you can feel safe using the app.

The main features of the application are:

- Fingerprint authentication
- An easy-to-use design
- Copy passwords to the clipboard
- You have more than 25 predefined icons to choose from
- Search bar to find your password easily and faster
- You can change your master password
- Reset the app with one tap

**CAUTION:** Make sure to back up your device/app because once you delete the app or reset your phone to factory settings, you won't get your data back. AccountStore stores your data locally on your device.

You never have to remember your passwords with AccountStore.

Enjoy!
